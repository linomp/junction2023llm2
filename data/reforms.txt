EU member states and parliamentarians on Sunday announced an agreement for a major reform to the bloc's carbon market.

The deal seeks to cut emissions by 62 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

Starting in 2026, the EU will start phasing out free CO2 permits it currently gives industries to protect them from foreign competition. In Finland, this measure will mostly impact the steel industry as well as the forestry and energy sectors.

EU legislators included maritime transport—key to the flow of Finnish imports and exports—within the EU's emission trading scheme as of 2024.

The agreement also aims to make households pay for emissions linked to fuel and gas heating from 2027, but the price will be capped until 2030.
