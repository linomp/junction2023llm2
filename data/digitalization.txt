1 Introduction

Mining techniques and technologies have evolved and improved over time eg the introduction of explosives and the use of mechanised and motorised mining equipment during the Industrial Revolution In the past each technical achievement and its implementation at mine sites led to better practices and strong industrial growth Today the mining sector faces the implementation of digital innovations and various terms have proliferated in the media the internet and at conferences describing these technological advances and associated imminent changes In this context authors freely use the terms fourth industrial revolution digital revolution digitalisation digital transformation intelligent mining smart mining or mining 40 Unfortunately these terms are used inconsistently although there are noticeable differences in the original definitions For example digitalisation originally refers to continuous evolution and change of particular processes and procedures based on digital technologies 1 Digital transformation describes the overall changing process of a company or business model due to the implementation of digital technologies 2 whereas intelligent mining smart mining and mining 40 limit the digital transformation to the mining industry 3 Regardless of the slight differences in definitions digitalisation is based on the application of digital technologies Therefore in this study digitalisation in the mining industry refers to the use of computerised or digital devices methods and systems and digitised data that are to reduce costs improve business productivity and efficiency and transform mining practices

To date the general direction and structure of innovative processes and the digital technologies for the mining industry as well as the influencing factors that encourage the implementation of trends have been identified 4 5 Others have discussed specialised digital technologies that are particularly relevant for mineral processing and beneficiation 6 7 8 However an appraisal of current digitalisation trends ie the general direction in which the mining sector is adopting digital technologies and of the implementation of digital technologies in the mining sector does not exist Hence in this study digital technologies relevant for the mining industry have been identified and their implementation in active mining operations of different production rates established By providing such information the study aids in identifying digital technologies relevant to mining operations and provides insights into the acceptance of digital technologies by mining operations of different production scales
2 Method

In order to identify digital technologies their importance and implementation in the mining industry coword analyses and textmining techniques with suitable algorithms were applied Coword analysis establishes the multi and cooccurrence of words ie content relation of two keywords and correlates the relevance of these 9 10 Textmining extracts from readable textual datasets hidden knowledge and semantic information 11 with most text mining programs using mathematical vectors and matrices The unstructured readable text is thereby converted into structured datasets that consist of individual tokens stored in singlecolumn vectors Tokenisers generate these tokens by using fixed splitting characters as punctuations or even letter sequences 12 In this study textmining was performed on a textual database and the generated vectors were treated as standard data sets and processed using a sequence of algorithms The latter algorithms were developed using the data mining software Rapidminer on a standard PC with 4 cores  34 GHz and 32 GB
21 Textual database

Initially global consulting companies perceived by the business magazine Forbes as leading in the mining sector were identified n  13 and then their insight reports were taken as the first data source n  26 This text database was extended to include papers published in industry magazines peerreviewed journals as well as conference proceedings and abstracts obtained through onemineorg Text searches were limited to information in English digitally available and published after 2010 In total over 2400 textural data items were identified All materials were stored as PDF files and converted into XML files using the software LaPDFText Detailed information about the functionality of the program and structure of XML files is provided by 13 The text searches revealed that published materials on emerging technologies were limited Consequently Wikipedia was used as an additional text source because it offers networked hyperlinks on article pages internal links redirects or categories making it an indirect powerful text collection 14 15
22 Coword analysis and textmining
221 Step 1manual review of reports

In the first step insight reports n  26 of global consulting companies were studied whether they contain digital technologies as keywords The sole criterion for selection was the term digital technology representing a software or hardware Identified technologies were stored as keyword vector vk and used in all five following steps as keywords
222 Step 2extracting and quantifying keywords

In the second step a textmining algorithm Fig 1 filters the previously identified keywords out of the insight report collection and quantifies the occurrence as a result The algorithm first turns the insight report collection into structured data by tokenising the text Step 21 Fig 1 The tokeniser splits the text into single words by using all nonletter as splitting points All tokens were transformed into small cases because the following steps are case sensitive The filtering engine cannot detect keywords consisting of multiple words Therefore words were combined to one token by using the ngram model Gwn see Eq 1 as described by 16

Fig 1 Flow chart for extracting and quantifying keywords Step 2 comprising Step 21 structuring insight reports Step 22 structuring keyword list and Step 23 filtering and quantifying the occurrence of keywords

A keyword list was prepared for the filtering process Step 22 Fig 1 by tokenising and transforming the tokens in small cases This resulting vector vk was used for the filtering process Finally keywords were counted according to their occurrence in a single paper term occurrence TO and the total number of words was established in the respective paper which resulted in the cumulated term frequency Step 23 Fig 1 From these data the nominal term frequency nTF was determined which in turn allowed comparing different TF values with variable paper lengths The paper frequency PF is defined as the percentage of all articles in which the keyword was mentioned1

where g is the final ngram w a single word and n the number of words
223 Step 3identifying semantic relatedness from the insight report database

In the third step the insight reports database was examined for identifying semantic relatedness between keywords Relatedness between individual keywords helps to classify these and draw a superordinate picture of all relations of digital technologies 17 18 The insight reports were investigated for interrelations by using the order of words to draw a conclusion on which keywords cooccur For this purpose the algorithm searches the immediate vicinity of a keyword text passage for additional keywords and stores the results in a relational SQL database Fig 2

Fig 2 Flow sheet for identifying semantic relatedness from the insight report database Step 3 comprising Step 31 structuring data Step 32 filtering tokens with vki at startend and Step 33 filtering for keywords

As a first step the unstructured papers were tokenised by nonletters and cases were standardised Step 31 Fig 2 The cumulative ngram function then processed the word vector with 25 semantic ordered words and directly filtered for the exact token length of 25 words as shown in Eq 2 This filtering pattern consisted of a regular expression RegEx which is often used for filtering or in searching algorithms as described by 192

where xn  1 and n is the number of the token length

Every element of the preprocessed word vector from Step 31 was searched and filtered by the keyword vector vk in an iterative process i Steps 32 and 33 Fig 2 The function under Step 32 filters all ngrams where vki is at the start or end of the ngram token The filtered ngrams were tokenised and filtered by the RegEx in i  3 for other keywords from the vector vk Step 32 Fig 2 Eq 3 is based on an alternative branch syntax ab3

224 Step 4extracting keywords from Wikipedia HTML

To analyse and use Wikipedia HTML structures the following step was designed iteratively For every single keyword vki the filtering process was processed and the results were stored in a SQL database Fig 3 In the first step the HTML document of the specific keyword was downloaded by a web crawler Step 41 To reduce the workload for the algorithm and to limit the standard word error rate 20 content extraction was used to delete unnecessary HTML parts by the RegEx in Eq 4 Step 42 Fig 3

From this the categories and internal and redirect links were extracted Step 43 Fig 3 The specific link structure of the items is shown in Table 1 The mentioned keywords were filtered using RegEx expressions This resulted in keyword connections with the same structures as created in Step 3 The results were merged with the results from Step 3 from the insight reports4

225 Step 5analysing keywords structure by using network analysis

Keywords and the interconnections between keywords can be perceived as a vast network The opensource program Gephi was used to visualise the network and to highlight links between keywords in the network structure Nodes and edges are the essential elements Here nodes represent the specific keywords and edges show the relation between two keywords 18 A forceddirected visualisation algorithm ForceAtlas2 21 which takes attraction and repulsion of the single keywords and their connections in consideration was used to design the network The resulting complex was further investigated in networking analyses by focusing on key parameters ie weighted degree WD closeness centrality CC and betweenness centrality CB which are discussed by 22 23 In particular the centrality of a vertex indicates the relevance of a node x to its dependence on other nodes Important centrality indicators are

    1

    Closeness centrality CC which indicates how central a node is positioned in a network CC is calculated by the average length of the shortest path dsp to all individual nodes y as shown in Eq 5

5
where x is the regarded node dsp the shortest path and y the connected node with x

    2

    Betweenness centrality CB which allows a statement about the relevance and importance of this node in the network CBx is calculated by adding all pair dependencies st of the network that contain x as a node as shown in Eq 6

6

where st is the number of shortest paths s and t the corner nodes of st and st x the number of shortest paths containing x
226 Step 6implementation of digital technologies at operating mines

This step determined the actual application of digital technologies at operating mines based on text extracts from the onemineorg database The algorithm in Step 6 Fig 4 filters the text database for keywords and searches additionally for the names of operating mines which are named in the text The results are stored together in a relational SQL database

Typographically the name of a mine begins in English with a capital letter In this study the PDFs from the paper collection were processed by the algorithm from Step 2 to detect the digital technologies within individual papers Step 61 Fig 4 To reduce the error rate structural elements with further capitalisation eg headings names and places within references and at the start of records were filtered and deleted Due to missing format information PDF files had their intext references deleted Step 62 Fig 4 by tokenising the text which resulted in vector w1 The correspond XML file with all wordspecific formatting and position information was used to identify headings which resulted in vector w2 Step 63 Fig 4 Table 2 The intersection of both vectors w1 and w2 was checked for proper names of mining operations by filtering words for uppercase formatting Step 64 Fig 4 The resultant list was linked to the identified digital technologies and stored in the SQL database

23 Overall methodology

All six aforementioned steps build an overall methodology to identify essential keywords from the scalable database and to draw conclusions about the acceptance of digital technologies in the mining industry Fig 5 Steps 1 and 2 identify and quantify relevant keywords from the insight reports and results as nodes in the network structure Step 3 evaluates linkages from the insight reports and represents the edges from the network Step 4 adds linkages from Wikipedia which completes the results from Step 3 Step 5 analyses and visualizes the final network structure Step 6 links keywords with mining operations which are mentioned together in the onemineorg database The results are finally visualized in heatmaps

3 Results
31 Identification of key digital technologies in the mining industry

Coword analyses and textmining techniques with algorithms on the insight reports n  26 allowed the recognition of 107 individual keywords after eliminating duplicates and using uniform spelling Term occurrences TO of these terms were established for each paper whereby the 10 most frequently cited terms were referred to 820 times in total Of these 10 terms the most frequently stated term with the highest TO in all insight reports is automation with 153 citations followed by big data internet of things robotics realtime data and 3D printing Fig 6 An analysis of the nominal term frequency nTF allows a comparison of the term occurrence with the paper length Looking at the average nTF together with the paper frequency PF the TO of the identified terms can be validated Fig 6 Automation occurs in 80 of all papers with a high nTF value However big data is mentioned in 60 of the manuscripts with the secondhighest TF Thus there is a positive correlation between TF and PF correlation coefficient r  089 in most cases except the term 3D printing that is mentioned in 44 of the insight reports but with an nTF of only 7 r  021

32 Application of digital technologies in the mining industry

Step 6 aimed to establish the actual application of digital technologies at individual mine sites Filtering the onemineorg database with 25 keywords reduced 2400 publications in total to 164 relevant texts In the filtered documents proper names of mines were established and 92 publications with a possible mine name citation were detected By reviewing the papers again manually 65 papers describing 158 mining operations could be identified All mines are existing projects that are currently in production have recently been closed or are evaluated to be reopened Among these publications notably automation realtime data advanced process control and machine learning show high TO values

The recognised digital technologies were then plotted versus the RunofMine ROM in Mta production for each identified mine site and versus the revenue of the parent company with multiple operations in bn using a colourbased heatmap see Fig 10 In Fig 10a operations are divided into five groups according to their ROM production rate 025 0251 15 510 and 10 Mta In Fig 10b operations are divided into seven groups according to their revenue 01 0105 051 15 510 1030 and 30 bn Colour saturation reflects the number of operations in the group which are associated with an individual digital technology In general digital technologies show more saturated colours with higher ROM production in individual mines and in companies with a higher revenue Especially those mine sites with over 10 Mt per year ROM production and companies with a revenue of over 1 bn have the most occurrences of digital technology terms By taking the number of average operations per parent company into account it is visible that more digital technologies are used in mining companies with multiple operations More than 60 of considered mines are surface operations 13 are mines with surface and underground activities and 24 are underground mines The share of surface operations increases with rising ROM In situ mining operations were not considered

Fig 10 Implementation of digital technologies at operating mines as a function of their ROM production rate and the parent companys revenue whereby a greater colour saturation indicates more adoption of the digital technology

Fig 11 shows the implementation of digital technologies across the entire mining value chain Some digital technologies could only be assigned to the entire mining process and here the term was classified as overall Related activities such as training and public relations were added as well Again automation shows up with implementation activities across the complete mining value chain Especially the stages of haulage and exploration are associated with abundant digital technologies Here realtime data is used in exploration activities whereas mine nerve centres are used exclusively in haulage and loading social media is related to public relations and advanced process control is mainly implemented in the processing steps comminution and sorting stages Regardless there is a general lack of colour saturation which demonstrates that the diffusion of digital technologies in the mining industry is overall quite low

4 Discussion

In the past technical evolutions in the history of mining were characterised by key technologies that were designed exclusively for the mining sector eg the use of dynamite or were taken from other industries and transformed existing mining practices eg the innovative use of motorised equipment Today a simple transfer of successful digital technologies from related industries to the mining industry is often not possible due to the unique technical and geological uncertainties and special conditions in mining operations 25

This study has shown that key digital technologies relevant for the mining sector appear to be automation robotics internet of things IoT big data and realtime data cf Fig 6 Fig 7 These terms have the highest TF scores but such an approach disregards the relation of different terms to each other When one considers closeness CC and betweenness centrality CB of keywords then automation machine learning internet of things 3D printing and  artificial intelligence have the highest CB and CC values as Fig 8 illustrates Thus in the mining sector a single key technology is not discernible in the current digitalisation trend Instead the present innovation process consists of a complex network of remarkably diverse approaches and new technology options Also the diffuse context and use of the terms mentioned in Section 3 inhibits an understanding and becomes a challenge for mining enterprises 18 26 Notably the mining industry has identified this development as a significant business risk with 37 of leading executives having insufficient knowledge and understanding of current digitalisation trends and available options 27 Thus important digital principles and linked digital technologies are not fully understood by and communicated to potential users Therefore it is of significant benefit to discuss the key digital technologies as identified by this study and to evaluate their future relevance
41 Key digital technologies in the mining industry
411 Automation and robotics

Automation and robotics are both an overall approach for decoupling the human from technical machinery Robotics deals with the development and usage of robots whereas automation defines the operation of existing machines and unattended processes without human control 28 29 The actual use of automation approaches concentrates on the processing steps whereby automation systems have been used for decades 30 Automation or rather autonomy technologies are actively used in the haulage process Fig 11 Especially surface mines use automated trucks where constant and longlasting haulage roads and simple implementation of communication infrastructures such as GPS or LTE allow the successful implementation of automation systems Yet loading of ore and waste by mobile equipment is still not being automated to the same extent The lack of automated loading practices is likely due to changing rock conditions and material positions at individual mine sites 31 which require realtime information and realtime data analysis

As seen in the results section Fig 6 automation is the mostcited technology which has already impacted on the mining industry Automation is affected or influenced by a variety of other digital technologies as shown by its highest betweenness centrality CB and closeness centrality CC values Fig 8 The CC value reveals that automation is a central component of the network and thus a central pillar in the current digital transformation discussion in the mining sector The egonetwork automation Fig 9e shows a strong correlation between robotics and automation as evidenced by a high CB value Similarly the egonetworks robotics and automation Fig 9d and e are connected to the same technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning and 3D printing Regardless automation is the leading key technology for the mining industry and is often seen as final vison of the digital transformation
412 IoT

Internet of things IoT is an approach whereby physical objects are interconnected and able to communicate their status over the internet and be controlled remotely from any position 32 In mining IoT is used in tracking the position and loading status of trucks which helps to coordinate mobile equipment There are also systems to track people for emergency situations 33 IoT monitoring systems are also applied to monitor rock stability and movements in underground mines 34 In particular IoT allows the connection of lowcost sensors to deliver data to a central point and to act as a crossplatform system 35 The IoT and the industrial internet of things IIoT share the same functional principles whereby the IIoT has been especially adapted for industrial purposes The focus of IIoT is on permanently running data intensive complex systems Aazam et al illustrated the components of an IIoT system where a wireless sensor network WSN virtual sensing cyberphysical systems CPS and big data are the main pillars of such a platform 36 At mine sites IIoT is used for the monitoring of tailings dams where parameters such as water level and movements of dam walls are measured 37

Results of this study demonstrate that IoT is named in more than 50 of all insight reports Also Fig 7 illustrates a very central position of IoT in the network with a high CC value which makes IoT a central component of the digital transformation discussion Closely linked to IoT is IIoT and automation artificial intelligence and machine learning representing the cognitive level of a CPS system are part of the IoT egonetwork Fig 9h IoT is a key technology for the mining industry Fig 6 and the results in Fig 9h underline that IoT as a datadriven technology reaches its full potential in combination with automation artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches
413 Big data and realtime data

The term big data describes a high amount of data that cannot be handled by conventional data processing and human competencies The term realtime data relates to the speed responsiveness and timeliness of delivering data to the user The mining industry can significantly benefit from implementing big data and realtime data analysis In fact predictive maintenance systems for belt conveyors or dump trucks rely on big data and realtime infrastructure which in turn allow a better forecast of mechanical breakdowns and status as well as tracking the equipment and operators 38 39 Other possible applications include mass flow simulation and visualisation of block caving activities to understand and monitor the actual mining void 40 Timecritical atmospheric monitoring systems such as methane and carbon monoxide detection as well as measuring dust exposure uses realtime data to spot hazards immediately 41 42

Big data and realtime data play a leading role in the current discussion Fig 6 Both terms have a high PF with over 60 and nearly 45 respectively Fig 6 However the TF of the two terms do not correlate with other digital technologies A possible reason may be that big data and realtime data are named as underpinning technologies which are the basis for other datadriven technologies such as IoT However big data and realtime data have similar egonetworks Fig 9f and g with both having machine learning artificial intelligence and automation as related technologies When it comes down to the analysis of multiple complex datasets where state of the art tools and instruments reach their limits big data systems are a key technology for success 43
414 Artificial intelligence and machine learning

Artificial intelligence AI has been defined as techniques that allow recreating humanlike cognitive abilities to automate tasks and processes 44 Machine learning ML is commonly perceived as a subcategory of AI and includes techniques that recognise patterns by learning from structured historical data 44 45 ML methods have already successfully been applied in the mining industry For example structured data from infrared spectroscopy or images from drones are processed by ML algorithms to determine the mineralogy of exposed lithologies in mining areas 46 47 Also mining operations use historical data together with ML techniques to reduce backbreaks and flyrock phenomenon in blasting operations 48 49 Predictive maintenance is done by the help of ML to recognize damage at mining and processing equipment to reduce unplanned downtimes and avoid fatal breakdowns 50 Yet overall the application of AI in mining practices has been limited

AI and ML are critical digital technologies Fig 6 and ML solutions are taken up by the mining industry Fig 10 Fig 11 Automation is strongly correlated to both technologies which can be attributed to the fundamental goal of AI and ML to automate tasks Fig 9a and b Significant challenges for the mining industry are increasing complexity and amount of geological and machine data as well as the loss of skilled operators 51 This is why cognitive technologies such as AI and ML are so essential in the future of mining
415 3D printing

3D printing is a process that creates 3D items from digital 3D models 52The items are produced by sequential layers of synthetic or metallic material 53 3D printing creates physical goods and consequently differs from the other digital key technologies In mining a possible field of application for 3D printing is produce spare parts and custombuilt components which in turn can reduce the cost of storage production and delivery times Similarly it is possible to use geological data pictures of drones or point clouds from laser scanners to create digital items and print those as 3D ore deposit or open pit models for illustrative purposes 52 54 55 Moreover 3D printed infrastructure models eg buildings are used to perform stress and damage tests under different geotechnical conditions 56

3D printing Fig 9c is related to automation as well as ML and AI since a computerised production process enhances an overall automation approach As printing spare parts are often a reaction to component failure ML can help to forecast failure and to start with 3D printing in advance so that downtimes can be reduced Also ML can help to improve the design of spare parts by analysing failed components 3D printing is also related to blockchain because this technology can ensure the origin of data avoid plagiarism and count how often a component has been printed 57Thus onsite production of customised spare parts through 3D printing has the potential to change the logistic supply chain of mines significantly
42 Diffusion of digital technologies in mining

This study has identified a number of key digital technologies Fig 6 that can reduce costs improve business productivity and efficiency and transform mining practices Many of the new technologies are yet to be adopted by the mining industry and individual mine sites as shown by the overall lack of adoption of digital technologies across the mining sector Fig 11 Other industries are rated better in an OECD digital index study Mining is rated low in the digital index but industries such as machinery and equipment or electrical equipment manufacturing are rated high 58 Industries were examined in relation to the comprehensively digitized hightech industry 59 Here the automotive industry is rated with a 31 digitization rate and the travel industry with 50 Where this digital frontier index is comparable to the adoption rate these values can also be used as target values for a moderate and high adoption rate

However the diffusion of digital technologies in mining correlates with the ROM production date Fig 10 Smaller mines appear to implement considerably less new technologies than bigger mines The degree of innovation and the level of investment in smaller mines are of course less than in larger mines but the costs for IT hardware have fallen sharply in recent years 60 so that digital systems should also be interesting and affordable for small mines Costs alone are therefore no obstacle for adopting digital technologies

The adoption rate of innovations ie the diffusion of digital technologies is characterised by the following five attributes 61 1 relative advantage 2 compatibility 3 complexity 4 trialability and 5 observability These attributes help to explain why large mines appear to have a higher diffusion rate of digital technologies

    1

    Relative advantage This term describes how beneficial a digital technology is perceived regardless of its benefits For example the mining industry expects a quantifiable reduction of operational costs 1530 31 by reducing its labour costs and installing automated systems Especially larger mines with a large workforce would benefit from the reduced labour costs which can also be derived from the results in Fig 10 which shows that the adoption of digital technologies is higher in companies with multiple operation For smaller mines this effect would be reduced due to fewer pieces of equipment and a smaller workforce 62
    2

    Compatibility This attribute focuses on the experience needs and values of the adopters and how the new technology fits in the existing system Realising digitalisation in bigger mines is enhanced through the presence of already existing infrastructure eg sensors and human resources Mines are very individual systems which are influenced by the geology and other local conditions This does not have a direct effect on the basic digital technologies such as automation or AI Moreover it influences the application of the system and the final implementation process
    3

    Complexity The term describes how difficult it is to understand or use the new digital technology Presently most mining industry professionals do not have the skills and knowledge to understand and use the new digital technologies Moreover some technologies like blockchain require specially trained staff and small mines do not have the resources to recruit these specialists
    4

    Trialability This indicates to what extent a technology can be tested or experimented Bigger mining companies often have research and development RD units and financial resources for testing new technologies and systems These RD capacities are often not present in the corporate structure of small mines
    5

    Observability This attribute indicates whether external stakeholders realise that digital technologies are successfully applied and used by mining companies A mining company that uses and adapts to new technologies may be perceived as role model or early adopter This image can be crucial for global companies that are intensively scrutinised by society Furthermore the observability of the outcome of new digital technologies is also important for internal stakeholders such as the management board and other decisionmakers This helps to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of an investment in digital technologies

Therefore there remain obstacles in the adoption of digital technologies in mining Adoption appears to be dependent on factors such as production scale of mining operations existing infrastructure availability of trained staff RD capacities and company willingness to lead in technology diffusion Regardless results of this work have shown an apparent deficit in the diffusion of technologies among smaller operations All these factors result in a final economic consideration that significantly influences the investment in digital technologies especially for small mining companies With less equipment and lower production the absolute savings are lower so that the profitability of digital technologies is viewed critically However there are several mine sites that demonstrate successful and economically viable implementation of digital technologies For example in 2014 the lonore Gold Mine in Canada installed an IoT system monitoring system which included sensors with wireless network for realtime tracking and control of the equipment n  400 and underground processes These technologies also allowed implementing a ventilation ondemand system which reduced the energy cost by more than 2 million per year 63 Another example is the investment into autonomous trucks at an openpit mine in Western Australia Pilbara 64 Total expenditure amounted to A18 million which included the autonomous trucks operation centre AI or MLdriven software as well as the communication network The mining operation benefited from this digital change through reduced labour and wearing parts costs A39 million and an increased production value A22 million Thus there are already several business cases in the mining sector that highlight the benefits of investing into digital technologies
5 Conclusion

This paper reviewed mining journals onemineorg the media Wikipedia and insight reports top consulting agencies and used textmining techniques to identify the key digital technologies relevant to the mining industry and to establish to what extent digital technologies are currently adopted by industry Results demonstrate that automation robotics internet of things big data realtime data machine learning artificial intelligence and 3D printing are the key technologies for the mining industry However in general there is a lack of technology diffusion and the diffusion of digital technologies depends largely on the ROM production rate There is an apparent deficit in the diffusion of digital technologies among smaller operations Larger mining operations appear to select and apply digital technologies suitable to their needs whereas operations with lower production rates do not implement the currently available digital tools and hardware technologies to the same extent These minor producers may require other digital transformation solutions tailored to their capabilities and needs and applicable to their scale of operations
